# Problem Solving Procedure (PSP):
* 1. Define the problem
* 2. Break the problem down into smaller parts
* 3. Solve for the smaller parts with pseudo code
* 4. If you donâ€™t know the tools to solve the sub problems, research it
* 5. Incrementally solve for each pseudo-coded solution using actual code and test it out

Daily Reminder:
- Network A lot! Guide to networking from a grad and former Recruiter at Google: https://youtu.be/kiDx2VaHa7o
- Live Office Hours: 45 minutes before class and 30 minutes after class
- Office hours with TA's can be scheduled for 30 minutes if by appointment. Otherwise, the max time is 15 minutes per session (due to need from other students)
- 1:1 bi-weekly meetings with instructor are mandatory.
  - [Calendly Link](https://calendly.com/omarpatel123)
- Please follow the following process when asking a question:
  1. Did I think about the problem myself?
  2. Did I check Google? Does the query match my problem?
  3. Did I ask others in the Slack channel?
- If all of the others are fulfilled, you can then ask instructional staff for help on a technical issue. For non-technical issues, please ping Mattie via email.

# Extra Credit

- Each week's homework can be improved by one homework grade by writing up your own pseudocode for that week's in-class activities. Just have your pseudo-code for each activity uploaded in a folder and pushed to your Github repo for that homework and name it `extra_credit`. Make sure to let the TA grading know that you've submitted extra credit. 

# Class Repo Updating SOP

> Use this every week to save last week's work in that week's branch (i.e. `week-2`) and pull in the new week's material

1. Open Terminal/Git Bash and `cd` into the class repository's folder (likely called `ucla-la-fsf-pt-03-2020-u-c` if you didn't change it)

2. Check to see what `branch` you're in by typing `git branch -a`, you should be in the previous week's branch. (i.e. If you're starting `week-3`, your branch would probably be `week-2`)

3. Save the work you did the prior week by doing a `git add -A` and `git commit -m "saving work"`

4. Now you'll want to get back into your `master` branch by typing in `git checkout master`.

5. When in the `master` branch, do a `git pull origin master` to get all of the updated content for the week.

6. Since you don't want to actively be doing work in `master`, let's create a copy of it by typing `git checkout -b week-3` (week-3 is an example of whatever week we're entering)

7. Type in `git branch -a` to check what branch you are currently in, you should be in that newly created one from `step 6`.

8. You're all good! You now have a working branch to do all of the class activities for the week without worrying about it being overwritten next time you pull down new content.

## Questions?

If you have any questions Slack it out to `questions`. You can always tag T.A.s as an option, but make sure you followed the Problem Solving Procedure (PSP) first.
